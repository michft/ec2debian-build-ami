## Plugins ##
In this folder you will find plugins made for the bootstrapper.  
You can run them via the `--plugin` option when bootstrapping:

```

* `standard-packages`  
  Adds some common packages to the AMI.
* `unattended-upgrades`  
  Enables unattended upgrades with aptitude. Your EC2 server will upgrade itself daily.
* `admin-user`

  Grants launch permission of the new AMI to everybody.
* `publish-snapshot`

* `remount`

  With this plugin you can inspect the results of the bootstrapping process without launching an instance.
